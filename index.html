            Red Dead Redemption 2 is an action-adventure game developed and
            published by Rockstar Games. It was released for the PlayStation 4
            and Xbox One in October 2018, with a Microsoft Windows version
            scheduled for release in November 2019. The game is the third entry
            in the Red Dead series and is a prequel to the 2010 game Red Dead
            Redemption. The story is set in 1899 in a fictionalized
            representation of the Western, Midwestern and Southern United States
            and follows outlaw Arthur Morgan, a member of the Van der Linde
            gang. Arthur must deal with the decline of the Wild West whilst
            attempting to survive against government forces, rival gangs, and
            other adversaries.
