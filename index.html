            Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice is an action-adventure video game
            developed by FromSoftware and published by Activision. The game
            takes place in a fictionalised, magical version of the Sengoku
            period in Japan, and follows a shinobi known as Wolf as he attempts
            to take revenge on a samurai clan who attacked him and kidnapped his
            lord.<br />
            Explore late 1500s Sengoku Japan, a brutal period of constant life
            and death conflict, as you come face to face with larger than life
            foes in a dark and twisted world. Unleash an arsenal of deadly
            prosthetic tools and powerful ninja abilities while you blend
            stealth, vertical traversal, and visceral head to head combat in a
            bloody confrontation.
